# reverse-reverse
 creates python's reverse method on my own 
 ---

 This project was created as a part of a class I took this past semester, spring 2022

What I learned
---
*more about the python reverse() method
*lists
*while loops
*functions
*list methods such as .append()
*the len() method

My thought process behind the project
---
1. look up python's reverse() to see how it works 
2. decide to use a while loop to iterate through a list starting at the end and moving backwards and adding each entry to a new revered list
